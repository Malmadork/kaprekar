# Kaprekar's Constant (6174)
6174 is known as Kaprekar's Constant after the Indian mathematician D. R. Kaprekar. The number shows itself when following the process below: 

1. Take any four-digit number, using at least two different digits (leading zeros are allowed).
2. Arrange the digits in descending and then in ascending order to get two four-digit numbers, adding leading zeros if necessary.
3. Subtract the smaller number from the bigger number.
4. Go back to step 2 and repeat.

The only exception to this rule is that four digit numbers with the same number for each digit will not work within Kaprekar's Routine 
(1111, 2222, 3333, 4444, 5555, 6666, 7777, 8888, 9999, 0). 

This repository holds a JS script for running Kaprekar's Routine as well as pages for data visualization and distribution information.
